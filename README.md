## About the Tool
This is an Open Source [AES Standard encrytion][0] tool.<br>
AES stands for Advanced Encrption Standard. It is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.
<br>
![AES][img1]
<br>
<p>
AES encryption has three different block ciphers: AES-128 (128 bit), AES-192 (192 bit) and AES-256 (256 bit). These block ciphers are named after the key length they use for encryption and decryption. All these ciphers encrypt and decrypt the data in 128-bit blocks but they use different sizes of cryptographic keys.
</p>

<br>
A file (*temp_key.txt*) for storing the encryption key(s) for file(s)/folder(s) encrypted using the tool is automatically created in the current working directory.
*Always make sure to backup the encryption key if not the files cannot be reverted back....!!!*

## Built With
* [Python][1]

## Getting Started
To run the tool locally, 
* Clone the repository. For instructions to [clone][2] the repo proceed [here][3].
* Follow these steps on your *OS*
  * *On Linux* : Open the terminal and make sure that the present working directory(folder) is the same as the directory containg the *File_Encryptor.py* file. Check this using the following command
```
pwd
```
It will display the path of the current working directory. To display the files/folders in the working directory use the command
```
ls
```
To execute the program file use the command :
```
python3 File_Encryptor.py
```
*Expected output*

### Working of the tool
**File encryption**
![output2][img4]
<br>
![output3][img5]
A file named *temp_key.txt* is created. It stores the encryption key. Also the name of the encrypted file is changed to *name.aes*(use this file name for decryption).

### Prerequisites
* Python3<br>
It is preinstalled in Ubuntu 20.04. To check the version use command :
```
python3 --version
```
If it is not preinstalled for some reason, proceed [here][4] and download as per requirement.
* requirements.txt<br>
Run the following command in terminal to download the required packags for running the tool locally : 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
